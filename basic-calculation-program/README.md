The purpose is to learn the basics of Rust programming language:
## Functions
## Primitive Data types
1. Boolean: The bool type represents boolean values and can be either true or false.
2. Integer:
- Rust has signed and unsigned integers of various sizes, such as i8, i16, i32, i64, i128, u8, u16, u32, u64, and u128.
- Naming convention: u8 - unsigned interger 8 bits (positive), i8 - signed integer 8 bits (positive + negative)
3. Float: Rust supports both f32 (single-precision) and f64 (double-precision) floating-point numbers.
5. Character: Rust's char type represents a single Unicode character and is enclosed in single quotes, e.g., 'A', 'ðŸš€'.
## Standard library
## Memory ownership
